# c++ programming 2021 @ dlut
When human beings acquired language, we learned not just how to listen but how to speak. When we gained literacy, we learned not just how to read but how to write. And as we move into an increasingly digital reality, we must learn not just how to use programs but to make them.

In the emerging, highly programmed landscape ahead, you will either create the software or you will be the software. It's really that simple: Program, or be programmed. Choose the former, and you gain access to the control panel of civilization. Choose the latter, and it could be the last real choice you get to make.

--Douglas Rushkoff, in Program or Be Programmed: Ten Commands for a Digital Age (2010)

## Introduction
### Overview
This is an introductory course to the C++ programming language, including C programming language. 
    It is intended for those with little programming background. 
    This course is offered during the Short-Term, which is a special 4-week term at DUT. It would be a 56 hours course (32 talks + 24 hands-on labs). 
    Students will learn how to use C++ to implment some simple algorithms, datastructures, GUI, and interesting missions in image processing and computer graphics.

- Course Instructor: [Junjie Cao](http://jjcao.github.io/); Email: jjcao at dlut.edu.cn; 
- Textbook: There is no requirement to buy a textbook.
